- title: **Follow up study on SR model**



1. why should we care cocktail therapy: what's the effect of taking different medicine together in human.
2. why LOG2 transformation? Intensity transform into [x]? Abundance?
3. Pearson correlation with?
4. what is Bootstrap?
5. why binning into 3? datasets limited. skewness. Why not simply regression? GLM.
6. serum proteins are different from those in cells.
7. Skewness should be done after transformation. Sign matters.
8. how to filter the targeted proteins?  mean up & CV down
9. why not fitting the analytical forms of X? Monotone functions simply satisfy. 
10. log2 twice? log2+1? What is the relationship between intensity & concentration.
